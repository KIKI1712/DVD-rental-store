# DVD STORE project
### Data comes with installation of MySQL

### Overview

Sakila Database was originally created by MySQL and has been open sourced under the terms of the BSD License.
The Sakila database is a nicely normalised schema modelling a DVD rental store, featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals.

Purpuse of this analysis is to demonstrate my skills in SQL and visualisation with PowerBI, to practice, and to have fun. I was not aming to answer any specific business question, but rather to get some interesting info from the data. 

Picture below shows first part of the analysis. As you can see , dataset conctaines multiple tables which gave me an opportunity to practice on of the most important functions - JOIN functions!

On the hastags (comments) prior to the query you can see the purpuse of the query and what I wanted to get out of the data. 

Here are some examples.

### Revenue by movie

### Here we can see that even though "Mike Hillyer" rented more movies, "Jon Stephens" generated more revenue
