# DVD STORE project
### Data comes with installation of MySQL

### Overview

Sakila Database was originally created by MySQL and has been open sourced under the terms of the BSD License.
The Sakila database is a nicely normalised schema modelling a DVD rental store, featuring things like films, actors, film-actor relationships, and a central inventory table that connects films, stores, and rentals.

Purpuse of this analysis is to demonstrate my skills in SQL and visualisation with PowerBI, to practice, and to have fun.
